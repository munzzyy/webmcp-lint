"""Turn findings into a security letter grade.

The score starts at 100 and loses points per security finding by severity.
Two hard caps encode the opinion that matters: any unresolved CRITICAL means
"do not publish this manifest" (grade F), and any HIGH keeps it out of the
top band (at most C). Hygiene findings do not affect the security grade.
